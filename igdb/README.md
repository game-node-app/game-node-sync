## Description

A NestJS API responsible for handling all GameNode requests.


## Docker
You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root folder to start a local instance of GameNode.  
It will automatically set up a Supertokens instance, the NestJS server, a MySQL database and a Redis instance.  
If you are looking to self-host GameNode (server), this is the easiest way to do it.

#### Important:
You still need to set up `.env` file. Most of the docker-compose parameters come from it. See [Installation](#installation) for more details.

#### Migrations and Docker
The default docker-compose files will **not** run migrations automatically.    
Migrations are dangerous and should be run manually, after checking each generated migration file.  

You can attach to any running gamenode container and run the migrations manually:
```bash
$ docker exec -it gamenode_gamenode_1 bash # Replace gamenode_gamenode_1 with your container name
$ yarn typeorm:migration:generate
# ... manually check the generated migration file
$ yarn typeorm:migration:run
# No need to restart the container, changes are made directly to MySQL.
```

If you are developing locally, you can use this command to spin up your containers and start the server:
```bash
$ yarn start:dev:docker # docker compose up -d && yarn start:dev
```

You can also attach your editor to the Docker container if it supports remote development (like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).

The provided MySQL instance will hold all data for both GameNode Server itself and from Supertokens.  

Bugs and issues related to migrations are not covered by support, and should instead be reported to the [TypeORM team](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).


## Installation
```bash
$ yarn
```

Use the `.env.example` file as an example for your own `.env` file.  
All parameters are required.  

You will also need to install MySQL, Redis and have a Supertokens instance running.
You can use a managed version of all of these services.

### SuperTokens
Hosting your own instance of Supertokens is not required for local development.
You can instead use their public instance url:  
```dotenv
SUPERTOKENS_CORE_URI=https://try.supertokens.io
```

### Database
After setting up your database credentials in `.env`, run the migrations:
```bash
$ yarn typeorm:migration:generate
$ yarn typeorm:migration:run
```

We use TypeORM to handle everything related to database. You only need to run migrations when changing the models (.entity.ts) files, or when you first start the app.
#### Important
ALWAYS check your migrations before running them. Typeorm may sometimes drop important tables and columns.

## IGDB
IGDB is used to fetch game data.  
It's mandatory to have a Twitch Developer account to use its services.  
You can create one here: https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create  

Use the client id and secret to fill the IGDB parameters in your `.env` file.
```dotenv
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_twitch_client_id
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitch_client_secret
```

The `IGDBAuthService` on the `igdb` module will fetch a new access token (which is a Bearer token) periodically, and store it in your Redis instance.  
Make sure it's secure.


## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn test

# e2e tests
$ yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn test:cov
```

Keep in mind that you can't (they won't show in SwaggerDocs) test Supertokens protected routes without a valid session token.  
This makes integration testing a tad difficult.  

## Support
Feel free to reach out to us through a Github Issue. We can help you set up your own instance of GameNode, 
or help you with any other issue you might have.

PS: If you have issues with overral app usage, please fill an issue in the corresponding repository.  
For example, if you have issues with the GameNode website, fill an issue in the `game-node-web` repository.
